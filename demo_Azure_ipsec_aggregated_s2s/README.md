# Azure site to site deployment connection between two cluster
## Introduction

This code will create two FortiGate clusters that connect to each other through Internet using an aggregated IPsec tunnel. Additionally, Linux VM machines are deployed for testing the performance of the connection between the two clusters. The iperf connections are automated to perform tests between the two sites upon startup. The number of IPsec tunnels and the number of Linux VMs can be configured as local variables in the code.
