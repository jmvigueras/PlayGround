# Multi HUB scenario with 2 HUB deployed in AWS and Azure and 1 site in GCP
## Introduction

This deployment will create a full multi HUB and Spoke scenario with 2 HUBs and 1 site. The traffic between HUBs and site is managed by fortigate using SDWAN technology and traffic inside HUBs is also controled by fortigates clusters. With this configuration all traffic will be inspected and controlled using fortigate L7 inspection improving security and visibility. 

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 1.0.0
* Check particulars requiriments for each deployment (AWS, Azure and GCP) 

## Deployment Overview

- Full deployment of a multi HUB enviroment with 2 hubs and 1 site. 
- HUB 1 is deployed in AWS. 
- HUB 2 is deployed in Azure.
- Site is deployed in GCP.
- HUBs are connected using a simulated L2 connection with an vxlan interface over Internet. 
- Sites created two different ADVPN with Hubs where eBGP is used for dynamic routing. 
- Fortigate configuration of HUB 1 deployment needs to be updated with public IP of HUB 2 for configuring vxlan interface. For this a Postman collection can be used that can be found [here](https://github.com/jmvigueras/playground/tree/main/SecDayMad/T1.hubAWS/postman)
- Variable files (var1.tf) that can be found in deployments T2.hubAzure and T3.SiteGCP, need to be updated with publics IPs and PSK randomly generated in first T1.hubAWS deployment.

## Deployment
* Clone the repository.
* Configure accesss secrets to access AWS, Azure and GCP in each terraform.tfvars.example which is allocated in folders of following deploment: [T1.hubAWS](https://github.com/jmvigueras/playground/tree/main/SecDayMad/T1.hubAWS), [T2.hubAzure](https://github.com/jmvigueras/playground/tree/main/SecDayMad/T2.hubAzure) and [T3.siteGCP](https://github.com/jmvigueras/playground/tree/main/SecDayMad/T3.siteGCP).  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
* Change parameters in the variables.tf.
* If using SSO, uncomment the token variable in variables.tf and providers.tf
* Initialize the providers and modules in each individual deployment as is described in it README file.
