# Deployment of FortiGate-VM on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
## Introduction
This IaC is a part of a full deployment of a HUB and Spoke with 2 HUBs and 1 site. In particular, this is code for a deployment of a site in GCP connected to two HUBs.  

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 0.12.0
* Terraform Provider for Google Cloud Platform >=2.11.0
* Terraform Provider for Google Cloud Platform Beta >=2.13
* Terraform Provider for random 2.2.1
* Terraform Provider for template 2.1.2
* A [GCP OAuth2 access token](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2)

## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - A VPC MGMT and HA - port 1 FTG for management and ha
   - A VPC with one public subnet - port2 FTG
   - A VPC INTERNAL - port2 FTG
   - A VPC SPOKE1 - port4 FTG
   - Two FortiGate-VM (BYOL/PAYG) instances with five NICs
   - Firewall rules for allowing traffic to public interface from internal, spoke1 and spoke2, also between spokes.

## Deployment considerations:
      - Update variables in var1.tf with data from HUB1 and HUB2 deployment
      - You will be charged for this deployment

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM to GCP:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Obtain a GCP OAuth2 token and input it in the vars.tf file.
3. Customize variables in the `vars.tf` file as needed.
4. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
5. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
6. Verify output.
7. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
8. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:
```sh
FortiGate-MGMT-URL = <https://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:adminport>
FortiGate-Password = <password here>
FortiGate-Username = admin
```

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
