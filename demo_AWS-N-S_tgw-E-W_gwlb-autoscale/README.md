# AWS Transit Gateway for N-S traffic inspection and E-W AWS GWLB for E-W traffic with autoscaling
## Introduction
This project gives an example of a scenario using [AWS Transit Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/) product to route traffic to two VPC inspections with Fortigate cluster. Firtsly, one VPC with a Fortigate active-passive cluster will inspect N-S traffic to Internet and SD-WAN sites connected to it. Sencondly, another VPC will inspect E-W traffic between VPC attached to TGW. 

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 1.0.0
- Terraform Provider hashicorp/random v3.4.3
- Terraform Provider hashicorp/template v2.2.0
- Terraform Provider hashicorp/archive v2.2.0
- Terraform Provider hashicorp/http v3.2.1
- Terraform Provider hashicorp/aws v4.39.0
- Terraform Provider hashicorp/local v2.2.3
- Terraform Provider hashicorp/tls v4.0.4

## Deployment overview 

* Step 1. Go to AWS-deployment folder to deploy in AWS
* Step 2. Go to GCP-site to deploy as many sites as needed in GCP (this step is optional if you want to try our SD-WAN solution and how it integrates with the complete architecture)

## Deployment
* Clone the repository.
* Change ACCESS_KEY and SECRET_KEY values in terraform.tfvars.example.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
* Change parameters in the variables.tf.
* If using SSO, uncomment the token variable in variables.tf and providers.tf
* Initialize the providers and modules:
  ```sh
  $ terraform init
  ```
* Submit the Terraform plan:
  ```sh
  $ terraform plan
  ```
* Verify output.
* Confirm and apply the plan:
  ```sh
  $ terraform apply
  ```
* If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.


## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
